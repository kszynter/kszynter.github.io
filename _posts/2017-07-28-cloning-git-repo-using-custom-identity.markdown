If you cannot clone your own github repository and you see 'Permission denied (publickey)' like this one:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone git@github.com:kszynter/kszynter.github.io.git
Cloning into 'kszynter.github.io'...
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
{% endhighlight %}

It's because there's a problem matching identities between github repository and your local computer.
First of all go check if you have any (public) SSH keys added to your github account [1]. If you have,
then this needs to match (private and public) key pair locally. They are by default stored in:

# windows
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.ssh

# linux
~/.ssh/

If you have any files there, they are named similar to this:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ls -1
id_rsa
id_rsa.pub
{% endhighlight %}

The one with a .pub suffix is a public key, and the other one is a private one. Both are what is called a key pair.
You need to add the public one to your github account [2].

If you don't have any files there or even the folder doesn't exist then you have to create a new RSA key pair [3]
and then add it to your github account [2].

Finally, if the git still can't match the identities (for example you can have multiple key pairs) then you need to
instruct git which one to use [4].
